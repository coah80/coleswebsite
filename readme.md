# Cole's Website

Hey! I'm Cole. This site is a little place where I keep my online stuff together. The home page shows my status and links to my socials, there's a page for recent activity, and there's a projects section for things I'm working on.

## Running it locally

Make sure you've got Node.js installed. Then install the dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will let you know which address to open (usually http://localhost:5173). That's it!
